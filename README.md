## 📊 Starter Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

**A foundational Business Intelligence report built in Power BI Desktop, focused on analyzing core sales metrics, customer demographics, and product performance to drive actionable business insights.**

***

## 💡 Project Goal

The primary objective of this starter project was to demonstrate the full workflow of a BI analyst: from connecting to raw data to delivering an interactive, clean report. The analysis focuses on:

1.  **Core Sales Metrics:** Calculating and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) like **Total Sales**, **Quantity Sold**, and **Profit**.
2.  **Comparative Analysis:** Breaking down performance by essential dimensions such as **Product Category**, **Customer Segment**, and **Geographic Region**.
3.  **Basic Trend Identification:** Using simple charts to monitor sales changes over the analyzed period.

## 🛠️ Key Skills & Techniques Demonstrated

This project showcases end-to-end proficiency in the essential stages of a Power BI analysis project.

### 1. Data Transformation & ETL (Power Query)

* **Data Acquisition:** Successfully connected to and loaded the raw sales dataset into the Power BI environment.
* **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Used the **Power Query Editor** to perform fundamental data cleaning, including:
    * Renaming columns for clarity.
    * Setting appropriate data types (Text, Number, Date).
    * Handling basic data quality issues.
* **Basic Feature Engineering:** Created simple calculated columns (e.g., extracting year or month from a date column) within Power Query.

### 2. Data Modeling & DAX

* **Relationship Management:** Established proper **relationships** (e.g., one-to-many) between fact and dimension tables to ensure data flows correctly.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Wrote core **DAX measures** to calculate:
    * **Additive Measures:** `Total Sales`, `Total Profit`, `Total Quantity`.
    * **Ratio Measures (Implied):** Calculated metrics like `Profit Margin` or `Average Order Value`.
* **Star Schema Implementation:** Structured the data model using best practices (separate dimension tables where possible) for efficiency and flexibility.

### 3. Visualization & Dashboard Design

* **Report Design:** Developed a clean, focused, and easily navigable single-page or multi-page report.
* **Effective Chart Selection:** Utilized standard Power BI visuals such as:
    * **Card Visuals** for high-level KPIs.
    * **Bar and Column Charts** for comparisons (e.g., sales by product category).
    * **Line Charts** for time-based trends.
* **Interactive Filtering:** Integrated **Slicers** and enabled cross-filtering to allow users to dynamically segment the data by Date, Region, or Product.
*
